## tl;dr

This RFC contains the details about the RFC process for all cellxgene related designs.

## Background

Previously the "RFC" (a.k.a. "design doc review") process was executed on Google Docs. There were two problems

1. Updates were quite tricky to make. Do you update the doc directly? Do you have a changelog? Which version is latest? Do you need to apply the change in the changelog in the body of the doc?
2. Design decisions were not easily accessible by our external community. How does the external community, with whom we have a close relationship, keep track of our decisions and progress if the designs are hidden in a private Google Drive?

In order to alleviate these questions and concerns, we have moved to Github to keep track of our RFCs moving forward.

## When do you need to create an RFC

- Your project will take more than 1 month to complete.
- Your project affects more than 1 discipline (i.e. requires frontend work and backend work).
- Your idea outlines a core abstraction of the project upon which other features will be built.
- Your project would benefit from an in-depth review and discussion from your peers.
- You'd like to have a record of an investigative project that you did that recommends future work direction. (See [IETF Informational RFCs](https://www.ietf.org/standards/process/informational-vs-experimental/))

Generally, err on the side of writing a small RFC over implementing a project without a written design.

## How to create a new RFC

The following are the steps to writing and approving a new RFC (not modifying):

1. Create a new branch of the `cellxgene-rfcs` repo. Suggested branch naming: `username/name-of-rfc-title`.
2. Create a new directory under the `rfcs` directory named `XXXX-name-of-rfc`, where `name-of-rfc` is the name of your RFC, not those words directly.
3. Copy over the contents of the `templates` directory into your newly created directory. This contains a folder for images and the RFC template.
4. Rename `rfc_template.md` to `text.md` and edit it. Add images that you'd like to include in the `imgs` folder.
5. When you are ready for review, create a pull request. Add your approvers (and any other people you'd like to review your work) as reviewers on the PR. Please note that [Girish Patangay](mailto:girish.patangay@chanzuckerberg.com) and [David Nichols](mailto:dnichols@chanzuckerberg.com) are required Reviewers for all RFCs so that CZI Central Infra and CZI Security teams are aware of cellxgene technical work. They may be removed as reviewers if the RFC is non-technical.
6. From this point, the method to get the RFC to completion is up to the discretion of the author(s), though ideally it should take less than 2 weeks (and usually around 1 week). A recommended option is to first vet the design by [Marcus Kinsella](mailto:mkinsella@chanzuckerberg.com) to get initial feedback followed by scheduling a meeting with the direct approvers to quickly iterate on feedback (while allocating part of the time during the meeting simply to read the RFC).  
7. Once the initial design churn has subsided post a heads up on the [#single-cell-eng](https://chanzuckerbergteam.slack.com/archives/C01CPJURT0S) Slack channel that there is a design available for review, and schedule a design review meeting by pinging [Arathi Mani](mailto:arathi.mani@chanzuckerberg.com). Ideally, approvers should be approving the pull request around this time and any feedback from the reviews should result in nit fixes rather than design overhauls.
8. Once all comments are addressed and the _approvers_ have approved your pull request, **change the name of your directory** from `XXXX-name-of-rfc` to pick the next number (for example, this one will be `0000-rfc-process`).
9. Merge your PR! Delete your branch! Close your design ticket! Code away!

## How to update an existing RFC

Minor and trivial changes may be made freely, with no announcement by the author(s) of the RFCs. Such changes include correcting typos, re-wordings, and the like.

If the change is major, the following are the steps to revising an existing RFC:

1. Create a new branch of the `cellxgene-rfcs` repo. Suggested branch naming: `username/name-of-rfc-title-amendment`.
2. Make your changes in the appropriate RFC. If there are new approvers, **append** them to the list of approvers at the top of the RFC.
3. Create a pull request. This is probably the most important step and most different step from creating a branch new RFC. In the top level comment of the pull request, ensure that you succinctly summarize the changes. The commit message should be a complete summary of the changes and why there were made. Also note in the top level comment of the RFC who the approvers are of the specific pull request. The thoroughness in the commit messages and top level comment is required so that the history of the RFC is much more easily accessible and comprehensible.
4. Post a heads up on the [#single-cell-eng](https://chanzuckerbergteam.slack.com/archives/C01CPJURT0S) Slack channel that there is a design modification available for review, specifically calling out the approvers. Use your best judgement on how much time you'd like for your modification to be under review, but roughly should be anywhere from a couple days to 2 weeks, depending on the size of the change. Note that huge changes like re-architecting probably warrants its own RFC.
5. Once all comments are addressed and the _approvers_ have approved your pull request, merge the PR!
6. Delete your branch.

## Alternatives

This process was initially done on Google Docs. As mentioned earlier, the process didn't work out well for keeping track of modifications to the RFC as versioning was not easy to use. Other ideas that was considered include [IETF's Github process](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-git-using-github-06) as well as the [Data Coordination Platform RFC process](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/dcp-community/blob/master/rfcs/text/0001-rfc-process.md).
