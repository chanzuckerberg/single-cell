## tl;dr 

This section should be one or two sentences describing the overall gist of the design. Someone should be able to read it and understand whether they should (or want) to continue reading the whole document.


##Problem Statement | Background

This section should provide some details on why you are creating this design. What problems are you trying to solve here?


## [Optional] Product Requirements

This section should come primarily from a Product Manager. For large designs, technical designs should be closely aligned with a product goal and thus should be explicitly bullet-pointed in this section to ensure alignment.


### [Optional] Nonfunctional requirements

Nonfunctional requirements are not directly related to the user story but may instead reflect some technical aspect of the implementation, such as latency. [Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement) a more comprehensive list of nonfunctional requirements.

## Detailed Design | Architecture | Implementation

I leave it up to the author to determine the best layout of this section in order to clearly render their design. Pictures are highly encouraged.

### [Optional] Data model

This section details anything from database schemas, to filesystem structures, to storage formats. Anything that "persists", is accessed by multiple component, or is something that could cause upgrade issues upon change, should belong in this section.


### [Optional] Test plan

This section details the sorts of tests that will be written to give confidence that the implementation matches the design. Enumerating the test cases is a good way to find holes in the design and helps the reviewers understand, in more detail, how the feature works. It also helps get into the mindset of test driven development.


### [Optional] Monitoring and error reporting

This section contains information on the monitoring and error reporting features that will be built in order for the system to respond and alert users on failures of the feature being designed. This helps ensure that failure modes are thought about and the users' experiences with facing errors is consistent and helpful, rather than frustrating.


## [Optional] Alternatives

Especially for larger designs, you probably considered more than one design so it’s worthwhile to briefly list the others and a short note on why you decided against it.


## References

Any relevant documents or prior art should be clearly listed here. Any citation of figures or papers should also be clearly listed here. Of course, they can also be linked throughout the document when directly referenced.
